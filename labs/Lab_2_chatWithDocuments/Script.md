## 1. Azure Services deployment

Deploy Azure Resources: - Azure Function App to orchestrate calls to Azure OpenAI and Cognitive Search APIs - Azure Cognitive Search Service - Azure Form Recognizer

Here are the SKUs that are needed for the Azure Resources:

- Azure Function App - Consumption Plan
- Azure Cognitive Search - Standard (To support semantic search)
- Azure Forms Recognizer (AFR) - Standard (To support analyzing 500 page document)
- Azure Storage - general purpose V1 (Needed for Azure Function App and uploading sample documents)

Right Click on ***Deploy to Azure button*** and Open in a new tab.

<!-- [![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FMicrosoft-USEduAzure%2FOpenAIWorkshop%2Fmain%2Flabs%2FLab_2_chatWithDocuments%2Fdeploy%2Fazure-deploy.json) -->

- Wait for the deployment to complete. The deployment can take upto 10 minutes.

- Once deployment is successfully completed, navigate to Outputs Section as shown below and Click on `Copy to Clipboard` to copy the output values along with the output keys in a notepad file. Please copy all the output values, we will be using these values in the next steps:

   ![Alt text](Images/lab-2-copy-output-values.png)


## 2. Setup Azure Cognitive Search and prepare data

As part of the data preparation step, the documents are chunked into smaller sections (20 lines) and stored as individual documents in the search index. The chunking logic is achieved with a python script below.

- Create Search Index, Semantic Configuration and Index a few documents using automated script. The script can be run multiple times without any side effects.

- Right Click and Open ***[Azure Cloud Shell](https://portal.azure.com/#cloudshell/)*** in a new tab and select `PowerShell`. If this is first time you are starting Cloud Shell, you will be prompted to create an Azure Storage account for the Azure file share.

  Run the below commands from cloud shell to configure python environment.

      git clone https://github.com/Microsoft-USEduAzure/OpenAIWorkshop.git

      cd OpenAIWorkshop/labs/Lab_2_chatWithDocuments

      pip install -r ./orchestrator/requirements.txt

- Update Azure Search, Azure Open AI endpoints, Azure Form Recognizer Endpoint and API Keys in the secrets.env.

  Create a secrets.env file in the ingest folder that will be referenced by the search indexer (search-indexer.py):

      cd ingest

      # create secrets.env using the built-in code editor
      # When using code, you can type control+s to save the file and control+q to quit the editor

      code secrets.env

  Copy the following to the secrets.env file and replace the values of AZSEARCH_EP, AZSEARCH_KEY, AFR_ENDPOINT and AFR_API_KEY copied in the previous step to secrets.env:

      AZSEARCH_EP="https://<YOUR Search Service Name>.search.windows.net/"
      AZSEARCH_KEY="<YOUR Search Service API Key>"
      AFR_ENDPOINT="<YOUR Azure Form Recognizer Service API EndPoint>"
      AFR_API_KEY="<YOUR Azure Form Recognizer API Key>"
      INDEX_NAME="azure-ml-docs"
      FILE_URL="https://github.com/Microsoft-USEduAzure/OpenAIWorkshop/raw/main/labs/Lab_2_chatWithDocuments/Data/azure-machine-learning-2-500.pdf"
      LOCAL_FOLDER_PATH=""

*   The document processing, chunking, indexing can all be scripted using any preferred language.
    This repo uses Python. Run the below script to create search index, add semantic configuration and populate few sample documents from Azure doc.
    The search indexer chunks a sample pdf document(500 pages) and chunks each page into 20 lines. Each chunk is created as a new search doc in the index. The pdf document processing is achieved using the Azure Form Recognizer service.

        python search-indexer.py


# 3. Test Azure Function App Service deployment
Choose your preferred method to test and confirm Azure Function App before continuing to Step 4.

## Option A: Test from Azure Portal (Recommended)

  - Right Click and Open ***[Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)*** in a new tab and navigate to the Resource Group deployed for Lab 2:
-
  - Select Function App:

## 6. Test

1. Click on the Home button on the top left corner in the Bot Framework Composer. Select the bot that has been developed in the above steps.

2. Click on 'Start bot' button on the right left cornder of the Bot Framework Composer to start the developed bot.

3. You can now test the bot in web chat. Click on 'Open Web Chat'. Please don't click on 'Test in Emulator'.

You can now ask questions related to 'Azure Machine Learning' to get the response from Azure OpenAI.

E.g.:

    What is Azure Machine Learning?
    Is GPU supported in AML?
    How to track and monitor training runs in AML?

You can explore integrating bot to other platforms, such as Microsoft Teams, a web application, etc. to augment the response returned from Azure OpenAI.
